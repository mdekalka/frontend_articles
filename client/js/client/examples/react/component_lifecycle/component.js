"render"
// When called, it should examine this.props and this.state and return a single child element.
// The render() function should be pure, meaning that it does not modify component state, it returns the same result each time
// it's invoked, and it does not read from or write to the DOM or otherwise interact with the browser (e.g., by using setTimeout).
// If you need to interact with the browser, perform your work in componentDidMount() or the other lifecycle methods instead.
// Keeping render() pure makes server rendering more practical and makes components easier to think about.

// Invoked once, both on the client and server, immediately before the initial rendering occurs.
// If you call setState within this method, render() will see the updated state and will be executed only once despite the state change.

"componentDidMount"
// Invoked once, only on the client (not on the server), immediately after the initial rendering occurs.
// At this point in the lifecycle, you can access any refs to your children (e.g., to access the underlying DOM representation).
// The componentDidMount() method of child components is invoked before that of parent components.
// If you want to integrate with other JavaScript frameworks, set timers using setTimeout or setInterval, or send AJAX requests,
// perform those operations in this method. (ofc, better create a service that return a promise from http request)

// Invoked when a component is receiving new props. This method is not called for the initial render.
// Use this as an opportunity to react to a prop transition before render() is called by updating the state using this.setState().
// The old props can be accessed via this.props. Calling this.setState() within this function will not trigger an additional render.

"shouldComponentUpdate"
// Invoked before rendering when new props or state are being received.
// This method is not called for the initial render or when forceUpdate is used.
// Use this as an opportunity to return false when you're certain that the transition to the new props and state will not require
// a component update.

"componentWillUpdate"
// Invoked immediately before rendering when new props or state are being received. This method is not called for the initial render.
// Use this as an opportunity to perform preparation before an update occurs.

"componentDidUpdate"
// Invoked immediately after the component's updates are flushed to the DOM. This method is not called for the initial render.
// Use this as an opportunity to operate on the DOM when the component has been updated.

"componentWillUnmount"
// Invoked immediately before a component is unmounted from the DOM.
// Perform any necessary cleanup in this method, such as invalidating timers or cleaning up any DOM elements that were created
// in componentDidMount.</xmp>
